				<h2>Image classification experiment on the <abbr title="M I T O S">MITOS</abbr> dataset</h2>
				<p>
					Detecting and counting mitotic nuclei is an important part of the evaluation of breast cancer histological images. However, distinguishing mitotic nuclei from non-mitotic nuclei and other similar structures is hard and time-consuming, therefore researchers are designing automated algorithms for assisting histologists in this task.
				</p>
				<p>
					Algorithms learn to detect mitotic nuclei by looking at a large number of examples.  In this experiment, we want to compare their accuracy with the accuracy of humans which, without prior training, are faced with the same task.
				</p>
				<p>The experiment is divided in two phases:</p>
				<dl class="dl-horizontal">
					<dt>
						TRAINING:
					</dt>
					<dd>you will look at a large amount of labeled images including known mitotic nuclei, as well as other structures which look similar but are known NOT to be mitotic nuclei. Just like our algorithms, you should try to find out some criteria to tell the two classes apart.</dd>
					<dt>
						EVALUATION:
					</dt>
					<dd>then, we will show several unlabeled images, and you will be asked to classify each of them as either <span class="label label-info">MITOSIS</span> or <span class="label label-warning">NON-MITOSIS</span>. During evaluation, you still have access to the full set of training examples to use as a reference, and you can take as much time as you want.</dd>
